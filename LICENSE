The Fun Part (Unofficial Developer's Pledge)
By using this software, you solemnly swear to:

- The first launch must play "Luk Thung" music on full volume while users perform a Ram Thai dance for at least 30 seconds.
- You must mail one (1) bowl of Som Tum to the author for every bug you report. Spiciness level: "Thai spicy," no exceptions.
- Failure to comply will result in a visit from the Spirit of Debugging, who will haunt your code forever.
